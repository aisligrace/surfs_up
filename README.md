# surfs_up
Module 9
## Overview
For this assignment, we analyzed weather data using SQLite, Flask, JupyterNotebook, and Visual Studio Code for a surf & ice cream shop in Hawaii. Specifically for this project, we looked at the tempterature data for June and December in Oahu, to see if it was possible to keep the shop open all year round. 

## Results
After using SQLAlchemy to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June and December, we converted each month into a dataframe and generated summary statistics for each month to compare.

* As you can see for June, the average temp for June is 74.9 degrees, with the min being 64 degrees and the max being 85. 
* These are all very comfortable temperatures for patrons to enjoy surfing and ice cream.

* For December, the average temp for June is 71 degrees, with the min being 56 degrees and the max being 83. 
* While there is an eight degree difference in the June min temp and the Dec min temp, both the average and max temps are within a few degrees.
