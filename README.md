# surfs_up
Module 9
## Overview
For this assignment, we analyzed weather data using SQLite, Flask, JupyterNotebook, and Visual Studio Code for a surf & ice cream shop in Hawaii. Specifically for this project, we looked at the tempterature data for June and December in Oahu, to see if it was possible to keep the shop open all year round. 

## Results
After using SQLAlchemy to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June and December, we converted each month into a dataframe and generated summary statistics for each month to compare.

* As you can see for June, the average temp for June is 74.9 degrees, with the min being 64 degrees and the max being 85. 
* These are all very comfortable temperatures for patrons to enjoy surfing and ice cream.

* For December, the average temp for June is 71 degrees, with the min being 56 degrees and the max being 83. 
* While there is an eight degree difference in the June min temp and the Dec min temp, both the average and max temps are within a few degrees.

## Summary
In conclusion, while there are temperature variations between June and December in Oahu as stated above, I would still recommend keeping the shop open all year. The temperatures in December are still high enough for patrons to enjoy ice cream and surfing. Also, December is a large tourism month for Hawaii, due to many people wanting to escape colder temperatures elsewhere. Closing the shop in December would mean missing out on many potential customers. 

However, we are only looking at temperatures in this analysis. I would perform the same queries using precipitation. Heavy amounts of rain in either month could skew revenue. I would also perform an analysis on March or April, as we did not condocut any analysis on the spring months.
